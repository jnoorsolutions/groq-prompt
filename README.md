## 🧠 Research Paper Summarizer using LangChain, Streamlit, and Groq API

This project is a simple interactive tool built with **Streamlit** and **LangChain** that uses **Groq API** to generate structured summaries of popular AI research papers. The user can choose the paper title, explanation style, and summary length — the LLM will then generate a customized explanation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 Select from popular AI research papers (like GPT-3, BERT, Diffusion Models)
- 🧠 Choose explanation styles: Beginner-Friendly, Technical, Code-Oriented, or Mathematical
- 📏 Control explanation length: Short, Medium, or Long
- 🤖 Powered by LLMs through **Groq API** with **LangChain**
- 🧪 Clean Streamlit UI for interaction

## 📋 Usage

Run the Streamlit app using:

```bash
streamlit run groq_prompt_ui.py
```

Then interact with the UI to:

- Choose a research paper
- Select explanation style
- Select summary length
- Click "Summarize" to generate a custom explanation

## 🧠 Example Prompt Template Used

```text
Please summarize the research paper titled "{paper_input}" with the following specifications:

Explanation Style: {style_input}
Explanation Length: {length_input}

1. Mathematical Details:
   - Include relevant mathematical equations if present in the paper.
   - Explain the mathematical concepts using simple, intuitive code snippets where applicable.

2. Analogies:
   - Use relatable analogies to simplify complex ideas.

If certain information is not available in the paper, respond with: "Insufficient information available" instead of guessing.
Ensure the summary is clear, accurate, and aligned with the provided style and length.
```

## 📘 Sample Output

> **Paper**: GPT-3: Language Models are Few-Shot Learners  
> **Style**: Beginner-Friendly  
> **Length**: Medium  

*Generated Summary:*

> GPT-3 is like a super-powerful autocomplete tool that learns from the internet...
> *(the rest is generated by the model)*
